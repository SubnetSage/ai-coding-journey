In the world of information retrieval, delivering the most relevant and concise information is paramount. With the vast amount of data available, it becomes crucial to not only retrieve relevant documents but also to present them in a way that is easy to consume and directly addresses the user's query. This is where contextual compression comes into play.

### What is Contextual Compression?

Contextual compression refers to techniques that reduce the size of the retrieved document set while maintaining or enhancing the relevance and quality of the information. By leveraging the context of the query and the content of the documents, these techniques filter out less relevant information and highlight the most pertinent parts. This process ensures that users receive concise and useful information without having to sift through large amounts of text.

### How Does Contextual Compression Work?

1. **Initial Retrieval**:
   - The process begins with an initial retrieval step where a broad set of documents or text chunks are fetched based on their relevance to the query. This is typically done using vector similarity search or traditional keyword-based search methods.

2. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - The retrieved documents are then analyzed in the context of the query. This involves understanding the specific information needs expressed in the query and identifying which parts of the documents are most relevant.

3. **Compression Techniques**:
   - Various techniques are applied to compress the documents:
     - **Summarization**: Creating shorter versions of the documents that capture the essential information.
     - **Highlighting**: Identifying and emphasizing the most relevant passages within the documents.
     - **Filtering**: Removing parts of the documents that are less relevant to the query.

4. **Re-ranking**:
   - The compressed documents are re-ranked based on their relevance to the query, ensuring that the most contextually relevant information is prioritized.

### Benefits of Contextual Compression

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed, making the retrieval process faster and more efficient.
- **Relevance**: Enhances the relevance of the retrieved information by focusing on the most pertinent parts.
- **User Experience**: Provides users with more concise and useful information, reducing the need to sift through large amounts of text.

### Implementing Contextual Compression in a Script

Let's look at an example script that implements contextual compression using LangChain, FAISS, and FlashrankRerank.

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.embeddings.ollama import OllamaEmbeddings
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.retrievers import ContextualCompressionRetriever
from langchain.retrievers.document_compressors import FlashrankRerank
from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Load and split the documents
documents = TextLoader("RR1_i9_startup-config.txt").load()
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=100)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
for idx, text in enumerate(texts):
    text.metadata["id"] = idx

# Create embeddings and retriever
embedding = OllamaEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text")
retriever = FAISS.from_documents(texts, embedding).as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 20})

# Perform the query
query = "What can you tell me about this router and what protocols are running on it?"
docs = retriever.invoke(query)

# Define a function to pretty print documents
def pretty_print_docs(docs):
    print(
        f"\n{'-' * 100}\n".join(
            [f"Document {i+1}:\n\n" + d.page_content for i, d in enumerate(docs)]
        )
    )

# Pretty print the retrieved documents
pretty_print_docs(docs)

# Set up the contextual compression retriever
llm = Ollama(model="llama3")
compressor = FlashrankRerank()
compression_retriever = ContextualCompressionRetriever(
    base_compressor=compressor, base_retriever=retriever
)

# Perform the compressed retrieval query
compressed_docs = compression_retriever.invoke(
    "What can you tell me about this router and what protocols are running on it?"
)
print([doc.metadata["id"] for doc in compressed_docs])

# Create and execute the QA chain
chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=compression_retriever)
response = chain({"query": "What can you tell me about this router and what protocols are running on it?"})

# Print the response from the chain
print(response)
```

### How the Script Works

1. **Document Loading and Splitting**:
   - The script starts by loading a text file and splitting it into chunks using the `TextLoader` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.

2. **Embeddings and Retrieval**:
   - It creates embeddings using `OllamaEmbeddings` and sets up a FAISS retriever to fetch the top 20 relevant text chunks based on the query.

3. **Query Execution and Pretty Print**:
   - The script executes a query to retrieve relevant document chunks and pretty prints the retrieved documents.

4. **Contextual Compression Setup**:
   - A `ContextualCompressionRetriever` is created by combining the initial FAISS retriever with `FlashrankRerank`. This setup ensures the final set of documents is both concise and contextually relevant.

5. **Compressed Retrieval and QA Chain**:
   - The script performs a compressed retrieval query and creates a RetrievalQA chain to generate a response based on the compressed retriever.

### Conclusion

Contextual compression enhances information retrieval by focusing on delivering the most relevant and concise information. By leveraging techniques like summarization, highlighting, and filtering, it ensures that users receive high-quality, contextually relevant results. Implementing contextual compression in your retrieval systems can significantly improve efficiency and user experience, making it a valuable approach in the realm of information retrieval.
